# HW11
 
This project uses an Arduino and 6 LEDs to display elapsed seconds (0â€“59) using the millis() function. The millis() function tracks milliseconds since the program started, which is converted into seconds.

The seconds are represented in binary (6 bits), where each LED corresponds to a bit (ON = 1, OFF = 0). As time progresses, the LEDs update in a binary pattern.

Key Features:

6 LEDs display the seconds in binary.
Simple and clear visual representation of time.
Can be extended to include minutes, fades, or RGB LEDs for customization.
